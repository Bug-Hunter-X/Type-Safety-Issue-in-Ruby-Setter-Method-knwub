This repository demonstrates a common type safety issue in Ruby where the setter method for a class attribute allows assignment of values with different data types.  The example shows that assigning a string to a variable that was previously an integer doesn't raise any errors, leading to potential runtime issues or unexpected program behavior. The solution provides a revised class that demonstrates type checking and handling to prevent such issues.
